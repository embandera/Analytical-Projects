## Mining User Data to Create an Index Score 

The factor analysis behind creating an index score can be quite subjective and complicated. One method of generating insights towards factor analysis is to collect and describe data that can help one to analyze connections between factors and outcomes. 

In this report, I analyze factors in a bank's customer data [practice dataset] towards helping to inform the development of a credit scoring system. I seek to analyze a customer's behavior and several customer factors (such as their marital status and family size) and how these might influence their ability to repay a loan. This report answers questions such as: 

- Is there a relation between having kids and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a relation between marital status and repaying a loan on time?
- Is there a relation between income level and repaying a loan on time?
- How do different loan purposes affect on-time repayment of the loan?

At the conclusion of our analysis, this report is able to recommend that the bank further explore making changes to their credit system based on several insights and predicted impact of customer factors in their ability to repay a loan. This may include tweaking their offers on loan amount and interest amounts based off of the following client information:  

- Family Size 
- Marital Status 
- Income 
- Loan Purpose

This report showed that the proportion of clients who had defaulted on a loan payment was different than the proportion of clients who had not defaulted on a loan, when disaggregated by family size, marital status, income and loan purpose. The difference was typically around 2% for certain factors; for example, we saw that clients who had 0 children, were a widow/widower and took out loans for real estate were less likely to default on a payment. Not surprisingly, we did observe a linear relationship between debt history and income. Our data analysis showed that clients who earned more, were less likely to have defaulted on a loan payment. It is important to dive deeper into this data, and we recommend that the bank define high-income earners and low-income earners, for example. This will help data analysts understand how to weigh the risks and offers to clients in the future.
