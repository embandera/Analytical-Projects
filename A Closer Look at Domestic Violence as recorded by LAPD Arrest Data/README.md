# A-Closer-Look-at-Domestic-Violence-as-Recorded-by-LAPD-Arrest-Data-Python

#### Summary 
This exploratory data analysis takes a closer look at DV-related data elements that are recorded in LAPD Arrest Data (January 1, 2010 to August 31, 2020) specifically on arrests categorized as "Against Family/Child". These types of arrests are labeled as FCDV-related arrests in this report. It is important to note that other arrest categories (I.e., Rape) may also be considered DV-related arrests. This EDA is part of an effort towards creating public health resources and educational information for residents of the City of Los Angeles. 

The DV-related data elements that are studied here are drawn from a Los Angeles County publication ['Domestic Violence Data Sources'](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/ivpp/pdf_reports/DV%20Report/LA%20County%20Domestic%20Violence%20Data%20Sources%208.25.10.pdf). These include: 
* Number of DV-related arrests
* Type of offense, including murder, simple assault, sexual assault, and intimidation
* Victim/offender relationships
* Age, gender and race/ethnicity of victims and offenders
* Type of injury sustained by the victim
* Type of weapon
* Location where the crime occurred
* Number of victims and offenders involved in the incidents 

LAPD Arrest Data contains some of the elements above but not all. This EDA project will continue to look for data sources to merge towards building a larger dataset that may be insightful for understanding DV-related trends and patterns in the city. 

The datasets analyzed in this report comes from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and contain information on arrests in the city and details documented about the arrests. The datasets can be accessed through the Los Angeles Open Data [website](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2020-to-Present/amvf-fr72). 

Update: An additional two datasets are introduced drawn from the FBI's [Crime Data Explorer (CDE)](https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/explorer/national/united-states/crime#about-the-data). CDE data is "derived from summary (SRS)  glossary lookup and incident (NIBRS)  glossary lookup reports voluntarily submitted to the FBI." All datasets analyzed in this report can be downloaded in this repository, with exception of LAPD Arrest Data 2010 to 2019, which can be accessed [here](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-2019/yru6-6re4).
