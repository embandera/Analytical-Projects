## Defining Parameters and Detecting Outliers
This report is an exercise in defining the parameters and detecting outliers for a dataset containing information about apartment listings (practice dataset). In this analysis, I mine an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years. Through several rounds of Exploratory Data Analysis, this report is able to determine the market value of real estate properties, define parameters and contribute towards an automated sustem that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.
